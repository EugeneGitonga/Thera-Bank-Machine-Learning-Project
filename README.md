# Decision-tree-classification-project

## Context
* Thera Bank is a US bank that has a growing customer base. The majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying sizes of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors).

## Data Set
* ID: Customer ID
* Age: Customerâ€™s age in completed years
* Experience: #years of professional experience
* Income: Annual income of the customer (in thousand dollars)
* ZIP Code: Home Address ZIP code.
* Family: the Family size of the customer
* CCAvg: Average spending on credit cards per month (in thousand dollars)
* Education: Education Level. 1: Undergrad; 2: Graduate;3: Advanced/Professional
* Mortgage: Value of house mortgage if any. (in thousand dollars)
* Personal_Loan: Did this customer accept the personal loan offered in the last campaign?

* Does Age have any impact of customer buying loan?
* Do people with less income borrow loans .?

## How to run this project from GitHub
### Method 1 : Using Binder
* MyBinder.org is a great project that allows you to create virtualized Jupyter Notebook environment from any GitHub repository. 
* You just need to enter the URL, and Binder will create a container for you, and start Jupyter environment. 
* Many repositories with Jupyter Notebooks include Launch Binder button to open the repository in Binder automatically.

* Binder will try to setup an environment best suited for your needs.

### Method 2 : Using GitHub Codespaces
* GitHub Codespaces is a great feature of GitHub that allows you to open any repository in a virtualized environment in the cloud, and access it through either online VS Code editor in your browser, or through local VS Code installation. 
* Currently, you may sign up for beta access to Codespaces, which will include some free compute to run your notebooks on.

### Method 3 : Run it in your local Python environment
* You can download the notebook from my GitHub repository and run it in your local Python environment using either browser interface to Jupyter/JupyterLab, or Visual Studio Code.
